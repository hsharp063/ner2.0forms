              <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Can you believe that June is already here? Isn't it great to finally see everything nice and green, flowers blooming and the smell of fresh air in the house?</p>
<p>Now is the time we move from doing the indoor work that needed to be done to doing the outdoor work that needs to be done; from indoor activities to outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Living in Minnesota, there is never any shortage of things to do no matter what the season. The newspapers and local magazines are filled with calendars of community events and activities to enjoy. For summer, this includes concerts in the parks, community festivals, beaches, walking and biking paths, and picnic places and the list goes on and on... Most all of these things are free. All anyone needs is possibly a blanket, some water, sunscreen, and maybe a little bug repellent.</p>
<p>My challenge to everyone is to be creative, to use the resources available to you, and to think of ways to make the lives of the people you care for as special as they themselves are.</p>
<p>Assume that the people in your lives who have limitations will enjoy the same things that you do. See beyond the disability and see the ability and the potential in all that they do. You will be amazed at how limitless their ability to enjoy life to the fullest really is.</p>
<p>If you like Valley Fair, or Como Zoo, or the MN Zoo, of course it is possible that others do as well. If you like the MN Twins or a concert in the park or an outdoor play, why wouldn't other people like it as well? AND just because you do not like it does not mean other people do not. It is after all, all about the people you serve.</p>
<p>When possible, let the people you work with make choices. This will help them feel valued and appreciate things that much more.</p>
<p>In some cases, you might want to plan ahead and make sure everything you need for the activity is available and possible. At NER, staff's job is to communicate information with the residents and with one another. Above all, take advantage of the many opportunities available to you.Â  As I mentioned, many of them are free and others are very inexpensive. This is an opportunity to try new things and to introduce the people served to new ideas and activities.</p>
<p>I am confident that as you make good use of the activities available in our communities, you will be pleased and you will find that your jobs are more fun and productive for all.</p>
<p>Enjoy this beautiful time of year, have fun, keep busy and as always, thank you to all caregivers for the excellent work you do and parents and guardians for sharing your loved ones with us. We are blessed!</p>

      <pageImage>1173</pageImage>
      <imageCaption />
      <pageContent><![CDATA[<p>Northeast Residence (NER) is a responsive and innovative non-profit corporation providing services for children and adults with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p>Incorporating in 1973, it was one of the first residential providers in the Twin Cities to serve children with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities. In 1981, NER began to provide overnight, short-term care (respite-care services) for families who had children with developmental disabilities living in the family home.</p>
<p>This cost effective, unique and most needed service has provided support to over 350 individuals and their family members.</p>
<p>Periodic breaks help keep families emotionally healthy by providing opportunities for parents to have time for themselves and for siblings to receive the attention they need, attention that is often difficult to get when a person with special needs is in the home.</p>
<p>In keeping with the mission and in response to concerns from families, NER continually evaluates and seeks input from the people we serve. In response, NER has expanded its services since 1994 and now has 24 long-term care homes, a short-term overnight respite-care program, a day program, two after-school (extended-day) programs, and in-home respite.</p>
<p>As time has passed, and with due diligence in pro-actively taking steps to meet our mission, NER has helped to educate the public about the rights of, and more importantly, the gifts that individuals with special needs bring to our communities. A variety of activities within the community and in the home provide an atmosphere of total equality and acceptance of all. In providing community based activities, the general public is naturally given the opportunity to see the interactions of children and adults with special needs.Â  In doing an excellent job of teaching appropriate social skills, ensuring that everyone in our care is clean and well groomed, NER can help change what has often been negative perceptions into ones of positive acceptance.</p>]]></pageContent>

        <imageCaption>NER provides out-of-home respite care. </imageCaption>
        <pageContent><![CDATA[<p>Since 1981, NER's overnight, out-of-home respite care program has served more than 350 families and is the pioneering model of respite care for families who have kept their children with special needs living in the family home. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The minimum stay for this program is 48 hours, with an average stay of five days.  While at respite, the individuals served have the opportunity to meet new friends, enjoy a variety of community activities, learn to spend time away from other family members, and prepare for a time they will move from their family home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For parents, this is the time the natural weaning process can begin.  As this process is often difficult for parents, respite care can also help prepare them for the inevitable.  Placement outside of the family home is almost always certain, either in an independent living environment or a supervised one.  Whatever the case, whatever the age, NER's respite care program can help prepare both parent and child.  This program is generally paid through the MA program.</p>]]></pageContent>

<p> </p>
<p>The programs provide care after school or after day program hours usually from about 2:00 PM until 5:00 or 6:00 PM.  They are also open all day from 7:00 AM until 6:00 PM on non-school or work days and during the summer break. This program is generally paid through the waivered program.</p>]]></pageContent>

<p>Like all people, our residents deserve to live life to the fullest. Donations help ensure a budget for special trips which are important to the development of social skills and increased independence. Thanks to your generosity, our residents can do more than just survive, they get to live. Gifts of all sizes are appreciated and needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Northeast Residence Inc. has several options for donors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#1">Annual Gift</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">The Endowment Fund</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">The Ken and Marion Owens Scholarship Fund</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Memorial and Honor Giving</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Estate and Planned Giving</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Recurring pledges</a></li>

<li><a href="#10">Charitable remainder trusts</a></li>
<li><a href="#11">Donor Bill of Rights</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="1"><strong>Annual Gift:</strong></p>
<p>Each year, NER has an annual fund drive to help support the ongoing needs of the organization. These include the day-to-day activities for the children and adults we serve. Trips to camps, client vacations, adaptive equipment, vehicle operating expenses, food and housing expenses, and staff training and development, are just some of the examples of areas that the annual gifts go towards supporting. These are all things that NER does to provide the highest possible quality care.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="2"><strong>The Endowment Fund:</strong></p>
<p>The endowment fund was established in 2010 to ensure the long-term future of NER. This is a designated fund, and the proceeds will only be used at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Your gift to this fund makes a perpetual difference. NER's long-term goal is to raise $2,000,000 for this fund, and then use only the interest generated from the investments in the funds.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="3"><strong>The Ken and Marion Owen Scholarship Fund:</strong></p>
<p>In 1988 Ken and Marion Owen began to support NER employees by donating funds in support of a scholarship fund. Every year since that time, at least two, sometimes three, deserving employees have been recipients of either a $1,000 or a $2,000 award. In addition, every person applying has received money to help pay for books and supplies. Our good friends at <a href="http://donatellis.com/" target="_blank">Donatelli's</a> restaurant in White Bear Lake have graciously taken on the difficult task of grading each of the applicants and are also proud supporters of the Ken and Marion Owens Scholarship Fund.</p>

<p>You can make a donation in memory or in honor of a loved one.</p>

<p>Estate and planned giving is a way to combine your philanthropic goals with your estate planning objectives, thus allowing you to support NER and meet your personal and financial goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are a variety of assets and investment vehicles that qualify as planned gifts and provide unique benefits for you. Planned gifts can be made with cash, stocks and other investment instruments, life insurance, real estate, or other assets, and can be made during the donor's lifetime or upon death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many benefits to planned giving. A planned gift may allow you to:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>

<li>Plan for the financial needs of a loved one</li>
<li>Provide inheritances for your heirs at a reduced tax cost</li>
</ul>

<p id="8"><strong>Retirement Assets:</strong></p>
<p>To reduce the tax liability for your loved ones and help ensure that children and adults with developmental disabilities served by NER are able to participate in all life experiences, name Northeast Residence Inc. as a beneficiary of your 401(k), Individual Retirement Account (IRA), or other qualified retirement plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tax-deferred retirement plan assets can be subject to estate and income taxes - reducing the value of these assets to your children or someone other than your spouse by as much as 75%. Avoid double-taxation and name Northeast Residence Inc. as a beneficiary of your 401(k), IRA, or other qualified retirement plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ask your retirement plan administrator to designate Northeast Residence Inc. as a sole or partial beneficiary:</p>
<ul>Northeast Residence Inc Tax ID # 23-730-9993 410 East Little Canada Road Little Canada, Minnesota 55117</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Or transfer the balance of your retirement plan to a charitable remainder trust. This allows you to make a significant contribution to educate, connect and empower children and adults with developmental disabilities, while providing NER with the resources needed for years to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be sure to consult your financial advisor before making a gift of your retirement assets.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="9"><strong>Publicly Traded Stocks &amp; Securities</strong></p>
<p>This is a great time to consider making a gift of publicly traded securities that have increased in value. You may never be in a better position to benefit from a gift of stocks, bonds or mutual fund shares and support Northeast Residence Inc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gifting securities benefits you in two ways. You could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn a charitable deduction for the full market value of the securities</li>
<li>Avoid capital gains tax on securities you have owned for one year and that have increased in value</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, gifts of securities are fairly simple to complete. If your securities are held at a bank or a brokerage account, send a letter of instruction to your broker or banker with a full description of the securities and your gift's intended purpose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For delivery instructions and to ensure you receive the appropriate tax credit information, please call Linda Lia at Northeast Residence at 651-303-7982.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you transfer the shares before December 31st, you may claim a charitable deduction on your tax return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As always, please be sure to consult your financial advisor before making a gift of stock or securities.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="10"><strong>Charitable Remainder Trusts:</strong></p>
<p>A charitable remainder trust (CRT) offers a way to make a gift to NER and provide income for years to come. To create a CRT, the donor transfers cash or other assets to a trust. The trustee manages the assets and each year income from the trust is paid to the beneficiaries. When establishing the trust, the donor must elect that regular payments be made in either a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of the principal to the beneficiaries. At the end of the trust term, the principal balance of the trust would pass to NER.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cash or property may be used to fund a Charitable Remainder Trust. Provided the trust meets all the necessary requirements, the donor would be allowed a charitable income tax deduction for a portion of the assets contributed to the trust in the year that the transfer is made. The charitable trust offers the opportunity to avoid or reduce capital gains when you contribute appreciated property. The amount of the deduction and the portion of income that is taxable would depend on the specific terms of the trust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be sure to consult your financial advisor before making NER a beneficiary of your Charitable Remainder Trust.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="11"><strong>Donor Bill of Rights</strong></p>
<p>The Donor Bill of Rights was created by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the Giving Institute: Leading Consultants to Nonprofits. It has been endorsed by numerous organizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To ensure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I. To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>II. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>III. To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>V. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VI. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VIII. To be informed whether those seeking donationsare volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>X. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.</p>]]></pageContent>
