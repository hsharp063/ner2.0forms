              <uBlogsyContentTitle>New Mission Statement</uBlogsyContentTitle>
              <uBlogsyContentSummary><![CDATA[A few months ago, one of our board members recognized that one of the things that sets NER apart from other organizations is that we do not just serve the individuals with developmental disabilities, we serve the entire family, and the communities in which they live. ]]></uBlogsyContentSummary>
              <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I hope you are all enjoying this wonderful time of year.  As many of you know, I hate the cold. But when it comes in December, it is easier to forget about it because of Christmas and all the many fun things that come with this very special time of year.  I love it all!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At our management meeting last week, I reminded the supervisors to be sure to connect with families and make staffing plans for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  If you have not yet coordinated times with one another, please do so ASAP so that employees can make plans to spend time with their families.  If it is easier for families to have the supervisor tell you when it works best for the house based on when others will be leaving and returning, please let them know.  For those who do not have families to celebrate with, NER plans special Christmas dinners and parties so everyone will have a very merry Christmas. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On another note, I am not sure about all of you, but I know for me, this year seems to have flown by!  I want to thank everyone for the part they played in helping to make this year such a great success despite the many challenges we faced. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>NER's Board of Directors has worked hard all year long to ensure that NER continues to meet rules and regulations, but more than that, the mission of this great organization.  We also welcomed a new board member this year.  Margie Miller heard about NER through the St. Croix Valley Foundation and joined the board this past summer.  She comes with a strong knowledge of the non-profit world and fundraising.  She is also the mother of a young adult daughter with Down Syndrome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few months ago, one of our board members recognized that one of the things that sets NER apart from other organizations is that we do not just serve the individuals with developmental disabilities, we serve the entire family, and the communities in which they live.  So with that in mind, after months of ideas and discussion, a new mission statement was created. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It reads:</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>NER creates opportunities for</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>children and adults with developmental disabilities,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>enabling each to live and make choices to fulfill their potential,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>ultimately enriching our communities and providing quality support to families.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To all of the wonderful employees working for the people we serve and their families, thank you for believing in NER's mission statement and for living it!  To the families we serve, NER thanks you for your trust in us and for all that you do to support us in whatever way that may be.  May you all have a very blessed Christmas and happy holiday season and a wonderful and healthy happy New Year!</p>
<p> </p>

              <uBlogsyContentTitle>New Legislative Requirements</uBlogsyContentTitle>
              <uBlogsyContentSummary><![CDATA[2014 is going to be a year filled with hours upon hours of training and doing some things a little different than before, in part because of the legislation that was passed.  The required paperwork is greater than it has been before and to some extent that is okay. ]]></uBlogsyContentSummary>
              <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope that you've all had a good start to the New Year.  January has certainly been moving along quickly.  In part, at NER, that has been because we have been extremely busy getting prepared to meet the many new legislative requirements passed in 2013.  By now everyone should have received all of the new policies that have gone in to effect, and NER is now in the midst of using the many new forms that have been developed as a result of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As annual meetings approach, people will see changes in forms to sign and papers to review, but what people will not see is a change in how NER views the important work we do.  Like New Year's resolutions, we have set goals for 2014 and we are excited to see them met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2014 is going to be a year filled with hours upon hours of training and doing some things a little different than before, in part because of the legislation that was passed.  The required paperwork is greater than it has been before and to some extent that is okay. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are also several new training pieces that are now required BEFORE anyone can work directly with the people we serve. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As providers we have a choice to make, we can complain about the new rules and regulations and how over the top they are (which may be true to some extent), or we can look at them as opportunities for the people we serve to help providers be even better than they were before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NER must choose the latter!  It takes far too much time and energy to complain.  We do not have time to complain and our energy is best used for positive things.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have a lot of work to do and we have a lot of people to serve who deserve the best care we can provide!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We also have a great team of supervisors, direct support staff, QDDP's, RN's, training staff, and administrative staff working together to do things right and we are not about to change now.  Please know that the safety of everyone we serve is now and always has been our first priority.  As we work together to meet the new regulations, we will not compromise in any way whatsoever to meet the high standards for which we are known.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In planning for 2014, I began to think of how we set goals for the people we serve and how we expect those goals to be met.  It is only fair then that as an organization we do the same.  Goals are not meant to be easy to meet.  They are to help us grow, to be stronger, and to be better than we once were. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Work related goals are very important and, in my opinion for NER they must be necessary, realistic, AND achievable.  When achieved, these goals have more potential to have more value and make NER the best provider of all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Think about it, we have taken on the responsibility of making a difference in someone's life.  We are expected to be teachers, coaches, and advocates.  What a great opportunity we have!  NER's responsibility is to provide the tools necessary to help all employees do those things.  That is huge!!!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>NER has an obligation, not only to the people we serve, but to our employees and to the families who have put their faith and trust in us as well. Orientation is the first step in that process, but it goes well beyond that.  It is what we learn about people from day to day that helps us be the best we can be.  We all have to be open to letting go of some past beliefs, and to really think about new ways of doing things, not just because the legislature passes new laws but because we can learn from allowing ourselves to think differently and more openly to new possibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you all for all you do!  2014 is going to be a great year!</p>
<p> </p>

              <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope you are all enjoying the slight warm up we have seen in recent days.   It's hard to believe we are nearing the end of February.  This is the time of year I really begin to feel energized knowing that spring is just around the corner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NER has already been preparing for our annual upcoming special events, and working with vendors for work to be done in the spring and summer.  There is never an end to the many things we strive to accomplish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have been glued to the TV every moment I have had the chance to watch the Winter Olympics.  I am in absolute awe of the talent and patience it takes to compete at such a high level. I remember watching the Olympics four years ago and thinking the same thing, and then relating that to the people we serve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>People come together annually, or more often as deemed appropriate by family members, case managers, NER, day programs, etc. and discuss all kinds of things about how we can all work together to help an individual reach his/her potential.  In an ideal world, the person served gives input into what he or she would like to learn, what skills to increase, gain, or maybe even explore something totally new.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I think is sometimes missing, sad to say, is an avocation.  When is it that we seriously consider suggesting helping someone learn to do something just for the pure enjoyment of it?  I am not suggesting that everyone needs to be an Olympian speed skater, downhill skier, or snowboarder, but certainly that does not mean we cannot do a  better job of helping encourage everyone to think outside the box and learn draw, paint, to sing a new song, or roller skate, or to do whatever their dreams might be. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe we have to spend a little more time helping people have fun and less time on "formal goals."    Both are important, but having fun is in many ways much more important, because as we learn from the Olympians, learning to do something you are really passionate about has many rewards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Success is not, or should not be measured just by percentages of trials accomplished, but also by how much we enjoy life itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I would like to suggest that just as the spring brings new beginnings let this year be one of new opportunities for all of us, especially for those we care most for.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As always, thank you families for sharing your loved ones with us and thanks to our wonderful employees for living out the NER Mission, you're the best!</p>
<p> </p>

              <uBlogsyContentTitle>Spring Is Just Around The Corner</uBlogsyContentTitle>
              <uBlogsyContentSummary><![CDATA[Isn't it wonderful to know that spring really is just around the  corner?  I love feeling the warmer air and even leaving the house without my winter coat.  Before long the robins will be singing and the early spring flowers will be blooming. ]]></uBlogsyContentSummary>
              <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Isn't it wonderful to know that spring really is just around the  corner?  I love feeling the warmer air and even leaving the house without my winter coat.  Before long the robins will be singing and the early spring flowers will be blooming.  But as a friend told me, if we didn't have the really cold, hard winters, we could not fully appreciate the other seasons.  I guess I will have to take her at her word.  I just know for sure that I am looking forward to a nice long spring and an even longer summer!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As usual, NER has some very busy months ahead and April is just the beginning but it is also very special.  April 6-13 is volunteer appreciation week.  On April 8th NER will host a volunteer appreciation luncheon at Manitou Station in downtown White Bear Lake.  This is our opportunity to say thank you to the many wonderful volunteers who have helped in so many different ways.  Thank you all!  Please join us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>April is also the time of year when we begin to think of spring cleaning!  How fun it is to tuck away the boots and heavy winter coats and exchange them for light weight jackets and begin to think of summer clothing.  Cleaning closets can be so much fun when you think about it in the right way.  It is our opportunity to rid ourselves of things we no longer want or need and to pass them on to others such as Goodwill or a thrift shop so people less fortunate than ourselves can have them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The feeling of a freshly cleaned out closet no longer cluttered with things we do not need is such a good feeling!  Now I do realize that this is not always an easy task for some of the people we serve, so approach is EVERYTHING!  It might be necessary to come up with a plan for the how, when, why, and where will things go once it is all out of the closet. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our son with autism loves to hoard things and I do mean hoard!  Any scrap of paper, a box, or any kind of container is a treasure.   Cleaning his closet is a major task!  Weeks beforehand we just discuss the possibilities so he can begin to process letting go of a few things.  Does he really need that pop tart box that I failed to grab quickly enough and throw in the trash outside before he found a place for it in his room? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we go through things one piece at a time, compromise is a must, the pop tart box can go, but the 20 plus pencils in it can be kept in the container he has along with 30 others.  The 15 t-shirts that are now way too short on him can go to Goodwill as long as we keep the two he just cannot part with because they remind him of a special trip.  After much discussion, he finally agrees that he will probably NOT read the 12 TV guides again found on the floor of his closet.  We are making progress as long as I remember to get things out of his sight before he changes his mind.  After a very long day, I can finally find my way to anything I need.  Shirts are hung in order, old ones are no longer to be seen so I do not have to ask that they be taken off and exchanged for a better one.  We are all happy again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just like working at NER, I have come to learn that sometimes things just have to happen.  Always, we have to have a plan, carefully think it through, and hope for the best.  We must also be mindful to respect that what we want is not always most important.  Each of the people we love and serve is an individual with rights to be respected.  At the end of the day, I have come to realize that we can encourage people to do their best to conform to "what we think is Normal."  But in reality, everyone has the right to be themselves with their own little quirks.  We do need to be somewhat concerned about a clean environment and safety, but beyond that, everyone has a right to be who they are.   And actually, that is what we love about them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this spring, when you go to clean out your closets or whatever it is you do, laugh at what you see, and be thankful you have the opportunity to enjoy the people in your life.  They are all special!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And by the way, have a wonderful and happy Easter!</p>
<p> </p>

              <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>For more than 27 plus years I have been blessed to serve as the Administrator, (now named Executive Director) for an organization with a Mission that I believe in.  More important I sincerely believe all those around me work diligently to meet that mission. It has been an honor to work with a board of directors so dedicated to the people served at NER and so willing to freely give of themselves to carry out the mission of NER, recognizing that the bottom line is not the most important thing that drives all that we do.  What really matters is quality care, supporting employees, and doing what is right. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With all that said, it is with very mixed emotions that I am formally announcing my retirement as the Executive Director.  In the very near future the board will begin their search for my replacement.   A definitive time for my departure has not been determined as I am willing to stay and help with the transition for as long as necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So many things have changed over the past two-three years with many legislative changes and possible new things on the horizon.  And NER has grown from when I first began.  We have grown from two programs to twenty-eight programs.   During all of this time we have continued to maintain an administrative budget of less than 11%, something we all feel very good about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the reality is, with all the changes the state has made, and with the growth NER has seen it is time for some changes to be made.  This has nothing to do with my decision but it makes perfect sense to make these changes now and it is part of the transition that will be taking place over the next several months and moving forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first step for this transition actually began with adding/hiring a new position at NER. I am very pleased to announce that Shari Newgard from our Human Resource department is now the Program Director.   Shari has been with NER for 14 years and has vast experience in the program area.  Prior to coming to NER she worked at a day program for 8 years where she was in a behavior unit, and then as a case management coordinator.  While at NER, she has lead classes for aspiring new supervisors, worked on our project committee, done QMRP work, covered for me when I am away, and has been the director of HR.  Shari's new responsibilities will include working with all things directly relating to long-term care programs and support services.  Just last week Mackenzie Sharbono was hired to replace Shari as the Director of HR.  Her background includes working as a director of day care in Texas and MN.  She has been at NER for the past four years first as a supervisor at our home on Cedarwood Court, as a live-in at City Rd. F, and then as the assistant to the HR Director.  Congratulations to both Shari and Mackenzie on their promotions!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an exciting time for NER!  I look forward to working with my successor.  </p>
<p>I will keep you all posted.</p>

              <uBlogsyContentSummary><![CDATA[Angela would surely love knowing that so many would come together to honor and remember her,  and of course, smile and laugh because it would be impossible to remember Angela without a smile.  She always had a smile and an infectious laugh!  
]]></uBlogsyContentSummary>
              <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A very long time ago, one of the employees at NER told me that what sets NER apart from other organizations is that NER is the company with "heart."  When I asked exactly what was meant by that, I was told that this was more than just a job to people at NER, because everyone really cares about everyone and we always support one another; residents and each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This could not have been any more evident than it was March 30 - April 3rd when one of our residents, Angela Watson, was taken from us as a result of a massive brain hemorrhage at the young age of 35.  On that horrible Sunday, current and former staff came to her bedside at St. Joseph's hospital to support one another and to pray together knowing that there was no chance of recovery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the next few days, as funeral arrangements were made, it was unknown how many people to plan for.  First thoughts were possibly 50, then came word that as many as 50 of Angela's friends from Special Olympics would be there, so that brought us up to as many as 100; a nice crowd to be sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Angela would surely love knowing that so many would come together to honor and remember her,  and of course, smile and laugh because it would be impossible to remember Angela without a smile.  She always had a smile and an infectious laugh! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The office staff worked diligently to help.  NER funerals always have a personal touch and this was no different.  It was a true celebration of the joyful and happy life Angela enjoyed at NER.  Photos were gathered and an amazing video was made to view during the service.  Beautiful personalized programs were made, and laminated bookmarks were made for Angela's friends to remind them to smile when they think of her.  Each of her fellow Olympians was offered one of her many medals won at Special Olympic tournaments to wear during the service and to take with them at the end of the day.  She must have had close to 200 medals and ribbons!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We ran out of programs and bookmarks because at the last count, close to 190 people came to honor Angela.  She had a very small biological family, but she had a huge group of friends from Special Olympics, and friends from her day program at Merrick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then of course, there was her NER family: former employees who had not seen Angela in many years, respite-care employees who had not worked with her since 2000 when she began receiving long-term care, her current staff, and all those who came to support their colleagues.  These are the people who make NER the company with HEART!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you one and all for all that you did to give Angela a beautiful and heartfelt send off!  She will be missed but not forgotten!</p>
<p> </p>

              <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Can you believe that June is already here? Isn't it great to finally see everything nice and green, flowers blooming and the smell of fresh air in the house?</p>
<p>Now is the time we move from doing the indoor work that needed to be done to doing the outdoor work that needs to be done; from indoor activities to outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Living in Minnesota, there is never any shortage of things to do no matter what the season. The newspapers and local magazines are filled with calendars of community events and activities to enjoy. For summer, this includes concerts in the parks, community festivals, beaches, walking and biking paths, and picnic places and the list goes on and on... Most all of these things are free. All anyone needs is possibly a blanket, some water, sunscreen, and maybe a little bug repellent.</p>
<p>My challenge to everyone is to be creative, to use the resources available to you, and to think of ways to make the lives of the people you care for as special as they themselves are.</p>
<p>Assume that the people in your lives who have limitations will enjoy the same things that you do. See beyond the disability and see the ability and the potential in all that they do. You will be amazed at how limitless their ability to enjoy life to the fullest really is.</p>
<p>If you like Valley Fair, or Como Zoo, or the MN Zoo, of course it is possible that others do as well. If you like the MN Twins or a concert in the park or an outdoor play, why wouldn't other people like it as well? AND just because you do not like it does not mean other people do not. It is after all, all about the people you serve.</p>
<p>When possible, let the people you work with make choices. This will help them feel valued and appreciate things that much more.</p>
<p>In some cases, you might want to plan ahead and make sure everything you need for the activity is available and possible. At NER, staff's job is to communicate information with the residents and with one another. Above all, take advantage of the many opportunities available to you.Â  As I mentioned, many of them are free and others are very inexpensive. This is an opportunity to try new things and to introduce the people served to new ideas and activities.</p>
<p>I am confident that as you make good use of the activities available in our communities, you will be pleased and you will find that your jobs are more fun and productive for all.</p>
<p>Enjoy this beautiful time of year, have fun, keep busy and as always, thank you to all caregivers for the excellent work you do and parents and guardians for sharing your loved ones with us. We are blessed!</p>
<p>Corrine Schmidt, Administrator</p>]]></uBlogsyContentBody>

      <pageContent><![CDATA[<p>Northeast Residence (NER) is a responsive and innovative non-profit corporation providing services for children and adults with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p>Incorporating in 1973, it was one of the first residential providers in the Twin Cities to serve children with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities. In 1981, NER began to provide overnight, short-term care (respite-care services) for families who had children with developmental disabilities living in the family home.</p>
<p>This cost effective, unique and most needed service has provided support to over 350 individuals and their family members.</p>
<p>Periodic breaks help keep families emotionally healthy by providing opportunities for parents to have time for themselves and for siblings to receive the attention they need, attention that is often difficult to get when a person with special needs is in the home.</p>
<p>In keeping with the mission and in response to concerns from families, NER continually evaluates and seeks input from the people we serve. In response, NER has expanded its services since 1994 and now has 24 long-term care homes, a short-term overnight respite-care program, a day program, two after-school (extended-day) programs, and in-home respite.</p>
<p>As time has passed, and with due diligence in pro-actively taking steps to meet our mission, NER has helped to educate the public about the rights of, and more importantly, the gifts that individuals with special needs bring to our communities. A variety of activities within the community and in the home provide an atmosphere of total equality and acceptance of all. In providing community based activities, the general public is naturally given the opportunity to see the interactions of children and adults with special needs.Â  In doing an excellent job of teaching appropriate social skills, ensuring that everyone in our care is clean and well groomed, NER can help change what has often been negative perceptions into ones of positive acceptance.</p>]]></pageContent>

<p>The minimum stay for this program is 48 hours, with an average stay of five days.  While at respite, the individuals served have the opportunity to meet new friends, enjoy a variety of community activities, learn to spend time away from other family members, and prepare for a time they will move from their family home.</p>

<p>For parents, this is the time the natural weaning process can begin.  As this process is often difficult for parents, respite care can also help prepare them for the inevitable.  Placement outside of the family home is almost always certain, either in an independent living environment or a supervised one.  Whatever the case, whatever the age, NER's respite care program can help prepare both parent and child.  This program is generally paid through the MA program.</p>]]></pageContent>

<p>Like all people, our residents deserve to live life to the fullest. Donations help ensure a budget for special trips which are important to the development of social skills and increased independence. Thanks to your generosity, our residents can do more than just survive, they get to live. Gifts of all sizes are appreciated and needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Northeast Residence Inc. has several options for donors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#1">Annual Gift</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">The Endowment Fund</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">The Ken and Marion Owens Scholarship Fund</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Memorial and Honor Giving</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Estate and Planned Giving</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Recurring pledges</a></li>
<li><a href="#7">Life Insurance</a></li>
<li><a href="#8">Retirement Assets</a></li>
<li><a href="#9">Publicly Traded Stocks &amp; Securities</a></li>
<li><a href="#10">Charitable remainder trusts</a></li>
<li><a href="#11">Donor Bill of Rights</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="1"><strong>Annual Gift:</strong></p>
<p>Each year, NER has an annual fund drive to help support the ongoing needs of the organization. These include the day-to-day activities for the children and adults we serve. Trips to camps, client vacations, adaptive equipment, vehicle operating expenses, food and housing expenses, and staff training and development, are just some of the examples of areas that the annual gifts go towards supporting. These are all things that NER does to provide the highest possible quality care.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="2"><strong>The Endowment Fund:</strong></p>
<p>The endowment fund was established in 2010 to ensure the long-term future of NER. This is a designated fund, and the proceeds will only be used at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Your gift to this fund makes a perpetual difference. NER's long-term goal is to raise $2,000,000 for this fund, and then use only the interest generated from the investments in the funds.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="3"><strong>The Ken and Marion Owen Scholarship Fund:</strong></p>
<p>In 1988 Ken and Marion Owen began to support NER employees by donating funds in support of a scholarship fund. Every year since that time, at least two, sometimes three, deserving employees have been recipients of either a $1,000 or a $2,000 award. In addition, every person applying has received money to help pay for books and supplies. Our good friends at <a href="http://donatellis.com/" target="_blank">Donatelli's</a> restaurant in White Bear Lake have graciously taken on the difficult task of grading each of the applicants and are also proud supporters of the Ken and Marion Owens Scholarship Fund.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="4"><strong>Memorial and Honor Giving:</strong></p>
<p>You can make a donation in memory or in honor of a loved one.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="5"><strong>What is Estate and Planned Giving?</strong></p>
<p>Estate and planned giving is a way to combine your philanthropic goals with your estate planning objectives, thus allowing you to support NER and meet your personal and financial goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are a variety of assets and investment vehicles that qualify as planned gifts and provide unique benefits for you. Planned gifts can be made with cash, stocks and other investment instruments, life insurance, real estate, or other assets, and can be made during the donor's lifetime or upon death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many benefits to planned giving. A planned gift may allow you to:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Make a larger charitable gift than you thought possible</li>
<li>Leave a charitable legacy for future generations</li>
<li>Plan for the financial needs of a loved one</li>
<li>Provide inheritances for your heirs at a reduced tax cost</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Please consider leaving a lasting legacy and support NER through a planned gift. Planned gifts are an ideal way to express your support of NER's mission, ensure the continued good work we do, and provide for children and adults with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are considering a planned gift to Northeast Residence Inc., seek charitable gift planning advice from qualified legal and financial advisors. NER works with Ameriprise Financial, and they will also be happy to help you. Please feel free to call Linda Lia for more information at 651-303-7982.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="6"><strong>Recurring Pledges</strong></p>
<p>Consider making a pledge to Northeast Residence Inc. Gifts are accepted in any amount. You can make your gift in installments and even pledge multi-year gifts. The Development Office will mail you pledge reminders on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis according to your preference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may <a href="https://app.etapestry.com/hosted/NortheastResidenceInc/OnlineRegistration.html" target="_blank">make your pledge online</a> or call Linda Lia at 651-303-7982.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="7"><strong>Life Insurance</strong></p>
<p>You may want to consider donating a life insurance policy to Northeast Residence Inc. Because so many different life insurance plans are available, it is a very flexible, financial tool designed to meet a variety of needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are several ways to support Northeast Residence Inc. using life insurance:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Name Northeast Residence Inc. as the primary, secondary, or partial beneficiary on an existing life insurance policy</li>
<li>Purchase a new policy naming Northeast Residence Inc. as a beneficiary</li>
<li>Donate a paid for life insurance policy to Northeast Residence Inc.</li>
<li>Purchase a policy benefiting your heirs to replace money or property you have given (or plan to give) to Northeast Residence Inc.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Donating your life insurance is a wonderful way to help Northeast Residence Inc. continue to support children and adults with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Be sure to consult your financial advisor.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="8"><strong>Retirement Assets:</strong></p>
<p>To reduce the tax liability for your loved ones and help ensure that children and adults with developmental disabilities served by NER are able to participate in all life experiences, name Northeast Residence Inc. as a beneficiary of your 401(k), Individual Retirement Account (IRA), or other qualified retirement plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tax-deferred retirement plan assets can be subject to estate and income taxes - reducing the value of these assets to your children or someone other than your spouse by as much as 75%. Avoid double-taxation and name Northeast Residence Inc. as a beneficiary of your 401(k), IRA, or other qualified retirement plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ask your retirement plan administrator to designate Northeast Residence Inc. as a sole or partial beneficiary:</p>
<ul>Northeast Residence Inc Tax ID # 23-730-9993 410 East Little Canada Road Little Canada, Minnesota 55117</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Or transfer the balance of your retirement plan to a charitable remainder trust. This allows you to make a significant contribution to educate, connect and empower children and adults with developmental disabilities, while providing NER with the resources needed for years to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be sure to consult your financial advisor before making a gift of your retirement assets.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="9"><strong>Publicly Traded Stocks &amp; Securities</strong></p>
<p>This is a great time to consider making a gift of publicly traded securities that have increased in value. You may never be in a better position to benefit from a gift of stocks, bonds or mutual fund shares and support Northeast Residence Inc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gifting securities benefits you in two ways. You could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn a charitable deduction for the full market value of the securities</li>
<li>Avoid capital gains tax on securities you have owned for one year and that have increased in value</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, gifts of securities are fairly simple to complete. If your securities are held at a bank or a brokerage account, send a letter of instruction to your broker or banker with a full description of the securities and your gift's intended purpose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For delivery instructions and to ensure you receive the appropriate tax credit information, please call Linda Lia at Northeast Residence at 651-303-7982.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you transfer the shares before December 31st, you may claim a charitable deduction on your tax return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As always, please be sure to consult your financial advisor before making a gift of stock or securities.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="10"><strong>Charitable Remainder Trusts:</strong></p>
<p>A charitable remainder trust (CRT) offers a way to make a gift to NER and provide income for years to come. To create a CRT, the donor transfers cash or other assets to a trust. The trustee manages the assets and each year income from the trust is paid to the beneficiaries. When establishing the trust, the donor must elect that regular payments be made in either a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of the principal to the beneficiaries. At the end of the trust term, the principal balance of the trust would pass to NER.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cash or property may be used to fund a Charitable Remainder Trust. Provided the trust meets all the necessary requirements, the donor would be allowed a charitable income tax deduction for a portion of the assets contributed to the trust in the year that the transfer is made. The charitable trust offers the opportunity to avoid or reduce capital gains when you contribute appreciated property. The amount of the deduction and the portion of income that is taxable would depend on the specific terms of the trust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be sure to consult your financial advisor before making NER a beneficiary of your Charitable Remainder Trust.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p id="11"><strong>Donor Bill of Rights</strong></p>
<p>The Donor Bill of Rights was created by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the Giving Institute: Leading Consultants to Nonprofits. It has been endorsed by numerous organizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To ensure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I. To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>II. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>III. To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>V. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VI. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VIII. To be informed whether those seeking donationsare volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>X. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.</p>]]></pageContent>
